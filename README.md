# scratch-tool
Tool for the Open WebUI software to let an LLM view and interact with Scratch.

The source code to add to Open WebUI is found in `main.py`.

## Why I archived this
The team at Open WebUI blocked me from communicating with them because I asked (without any accusations) why they used emojis in their release notes. I was not given any possibility of explaining myself before the block happened, and I was not provided with the reason why it occurred. A quick glance at their Code of Conduct showed nothing about asking standard questions such as mine, and they did not warn me beforehand.

Here's some things that they could have done instead:
- Ignore me and move on
- Delete the post
- Warn me then block me for a couple days to send a message
- Inform me that they were somehow offended so that I could apologize

The assumption when using Internet communication systems is that all parties involved should be able to call someone out and move on if they're offended. If you don't feel that you have the tools to do so, you should make that exceedingly clear _before_ communications happen.

I do not wish to develop software which will almost exclusively be used to support organizations that encourage such absurd behavior.
